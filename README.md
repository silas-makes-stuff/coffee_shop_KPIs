## **Goal**
1. Practice some basic Excel EDA
2. Data analysis using Python

Examined
1. What are the average quality and difficulty ratings of routes by location? What are the average quality and difficulty ratings by type of route (sport, trad, TR)?
2. Where is the best location for beginner, intermediate, and advanced climbers to find the most amount of high quality routes? At which climbing walls are they located?

## Description
This project uses data sourced from Mountain Project to explore the available rock climbing routes in Iowa, their types, subtypes, wall locations, safety ratings, and average climber reviews. The analysis aimed to extract relevant insights on climb quality, grade, and location. Key tasks included data extraction, data cleaning and refining, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization using Excel and Tableau.
